            <h2>Problem Statement: Trail Mix</h2>
            <p>Users have difficulty juggling a multitude of private transportation apps when they need
                transportation in a city. They feel like it would be easier to have one app that combines all
                private and public transportation in an area into one, easily accessible application.
